# D

D is an open-source, decentralized computing and storage network that allows users to contribute their idle compute power and storage in exchange for payments, while enabling developers to access distributed, cost-efficient resources. It is designed as an alternative to traditional cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure—without a central authority.

## Vision
To create a **Decentralized cloud**, where computing power and storage are distributed across millions of devices globally, making it **scalable, efficient, and cheap**.

## How It Works
1. **Users Install the D App** → Join the network as a **node** by sharing compute & storage.
2. **Offer Nodes for Compute** →  Users can offer their devices to receive traffic and execute tasks.
3. **Use Nodes as servers** →  Users can pay and use the nodes as servers for various uses.
4. **Decentralized Storage** → Files are sharded, encrypted, and distributed across nodes.
5. **Load Balancer** → Distributes computing tasks dynamically.
