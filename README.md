# D

D is an open-source, decentralized computing and storage network that allows users to contribute their idle compute power and storage in exchange for payments, while enabling developers to access distributed, cost-efficient resources. It is designed as an alternative to traditional cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure—without a central authority.

## Vision
To create a **truly decentralized cloud**, where computing power and storage are distributed across millions of devices globally, making it **scalable, efficient, and censorship-resistant**.

## How It Works
1. **Users Install the D App** → Join the network as a **node** by sharing compute & storage.
2. **AI-Powered Job Scheduler** → Distributes computing tasks dynamically.
3. **Decentralized Storage** → Files are sharded, encrypted, and distributed across nodes.
4. **Blockchain-Based Payments** → Nodes get paid for contributing compute & storage.

## Architecture Overview
### **Node Types**
- **Light Nodes** (Mobile) → Share small compute/storage.
- **Power Nodes** (PCs/Servers) → Handle heavy workloads.
- **Master Nodes** (Staked Nodes) → Coordinate jobs & prevent abuse.

### **Core Components**
- **Compute Layer** → Assigns workloads to optimal nodes.
- **Storage Layer** → Handles decentralized file storage.
- **Load Balancerr** → Optimizes workload distribution.
- **Payment System** → Uses blockchain for automatic payments.

### **Monitoring & Transparency**
- **Node Explorer** → Shows real-time node status & compute availability.
- **Blockchain Ledger** → Logs compute/storage contributions & payments.
- **Decentralized Governance** → Users vote on protocol upgrades.
